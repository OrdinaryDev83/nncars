# Artificial Evolutionary Neural Network that Drive 2D Cars
This is a 2D Unity Project that implements simple self driving cars.
It uses a basic neural network layout which can have a variable amount of inputs (here sensors).
The network consists of the inputs layer, one hidden layer and the output layer.
The output layer has one neuron for acceleration, one for steering.
Nearly every aspect of the simulation is tweakable.
The weights / biases configuration of the neural networks can be saved and loaded in text files.
Made in ~24H to discover machine learning mathematically and in programming.
